# Useful-Python-libraries-for-Data-Science
In this repository, I am trying to compile some useful Python libraries for data science tasks other than the commonly used ones like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc. My idea is to regularly update the kernel to include some awesome Python libraries which can real come in handy for the Data Analysis and Machine learning tasks.
